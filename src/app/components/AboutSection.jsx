                        My name is Joseph Anurag Mohanty. I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.rice.edu" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Rice University</a>, with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science Engineering from <a href="https://www.manipal.edu/mit.html" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Manipal Institute of Technology</a>. I am specializing in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning. With a strong foundation in software development and a keen interest in emerging technologies, I have continually sought out opportunities to apply my skills to real-world challenges.

                        Currently, I am working as a Research Assistant under <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~cmj4/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">Professor Chris Jermaine</a>. We are working on a Machine Learning system - Einsummable - that automatically distributes ML compute graphs across clusters of CPU or GPU machines. It is based on the idea that tensors are relations mapping positions to values and all operations are therefore relational. The benefit of treating ML compute graphs as relational queries is that they can be easily reasoned and optimized over.

                        Prior to joining Rice, I worked as Tech Engineer at <a href="https://www.ubs.com/us/en.html" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700">UBS</a> in their Investment Banking Division, where I was part of the CAIP (Corporate Actions and Income Processing) Team. I primarily contributed to leading code release activities for our application suite.
